I am a final year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin fortunate to be advised by Professor [Rachel Ward](https://sites.google.com/prod/view/rward).  Before UT I received my undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Chicago.

My interests lie broadly in the foundations of data science.  For more information about my research see [here](https://rhshi.github.io/research/).

I can be contacted at bhshi at -no spam- utexas dot edu.
