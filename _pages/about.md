I am a final year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin fortunate to be advised by Professor [Rachel Ward](https://sites.google.com/prod/view/rward).  Before UT I received my undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Chicago.

My [research](https://rhshi.github.io/research/) lies broadly in the foundations of data science.

I can be contacted at bhshi at -no spam- utexas dot edu.
