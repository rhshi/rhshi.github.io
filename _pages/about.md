I am a fourth-year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin fortunate to be advised by Professor [Rachel Ward](https://sites.google.com/prod/view/rward).  Before UT I received my undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Chicago where I studied reinforcement learning and robots with Professor [Matt Walter](https://home.ttic.edu/~mwalter/).

My interests lie broadly in the foundations of data science.  For more information about my research see [here](https://rhshi.github.io/research/).

I can be contacted at bhshi at -no spam- utexas dot edu.
