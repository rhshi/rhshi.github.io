I am a third-year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin fortunate to be advised by Professor [Rachel Ward](https://sites.google.com/prod/view/rward).  I am also grateful to have collaborated with (both presently and previously) Professors [Joe Kileel](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/jkileel/), [Purnamrita Sarkar](https://psarkar.github.io/), and [Maria De-Arteaga](https://mariadearteaga.com/).  Before UT I received my undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Chicago where I worked on robots with Professor [Matt Walter](https://home.ttic.edu/~mwalter/).

My interests lie broadly in the foundations of data science, using methods from statistics, high-dimensional probability, and optimization, and algebraic geometry.  In the past I have worked on sparse approximation, random features, and algorithmic fairness.  For more information about my research see [here](https://rhshi.github.io/research/).
